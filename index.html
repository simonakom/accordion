            <div class="accordion"><p>What are the key principles of UX design?</p></div>
            <p class="description">The key principles of UX design include user-centered design, where the focus is on understanding and meeting user needs throughout the design process. Usability is paramount, ensuring that the product is easy to use and efficient. Consistency in design elements and interactions helps reduce cognitive load and enhances user understanding. Clear communication through simple language and visual elements contributes to a positive user experience.

            <div class="accordion"><p>What is the difference between UX and UI design?</p></div>
            <p class="description mb-5">User Experience (UX) design focuses on enhancing the overall interaction and satisfaction of users by considering the entire journey and user needs. User Interface (UI) design specifically deals with the visual elements of a product, emphasizing aesthetics, layout, and interactive components. While UX is concerned with the overall user experience, UI concentrates on creating an appealing and user-friendly visual interface.</p>
